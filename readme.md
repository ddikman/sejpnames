# SE-JP Names

Small script to join, normalize and convert Swedish names to Katakana to check how they would work in Japanese.

## usage

Requires two files to exist in the same dictionary with the format like `example_input.csv` called `pojknamn.csv` and `flicknamn.csv`.

```
python japanify.py
```

## disclaimer

This library seem strange? Well, probably because it is a bit strange. I thought I would save the code I used for future examples but I'm not at liberty to share the actual data in the repository, for that reason I've left in only a part of the data in here.
